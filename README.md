ℹ️ API calls are mapped on a [jHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) backend application.

## Installation

```
yarn install
yarn build
```

## Development

```
yarn dev
```

### Development with a jHipster backend

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project with the following content:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```

## Show hint on development environments

Setup the `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_ENV_NAME` env variable with the name of the environment.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_ENV_NAME=staging
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_ENV_COLOR_SCHEME=teal
```

## Production

### NodeJS (recommended)

```
yarn build
yarn start
```

### Static

```
yarn static:build
```

Then expose the `/out` folder.

💡 You will need to setup your server to rewrite all `/app/*` urls to serve the `app.html` file.
